HPC Data Analysis Solution for Genomics FastQ Sample Files
----------


----------


**Problem Statement**

 - Data Analysis - the most crucial step for DNA sequencing, demands
   tremendous amount of HPC power.
 - HPC combined with Big Data orchestrates and executes multiple Open
   Source tools per DNA sample.
 - Limited capacity of the required HPC infrastructure increases the per
   sample processing time.
 - Reprocessing thousands of analyzed samples with new reference data
   becomes impossible due to such limitations.
