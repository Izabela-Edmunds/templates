Thanks for visiting our templates repository. Here you can find different repeatable solution templates including:

 - Details describing the specific problem domain we have taken as a
   subject and steps required for solution domain implementation.
   
 - Sample application code and the interaction between required and   
   optional components.

 - Microsoft Cloud Templates and scripts to deploy the solution inside  
   your own Azure subscription.
  
 - Sample input and output data to try out the solution yourself using
   your own Azure subscription.
